<h3 id="profile">Profile</h3>
<p>People describe me best as being ambitious, studious and resolute. It is my ambition to attain a challenging economic job with a high level of self-responsibility within a dynamic organization. As I am eager to learn from new insights in my field, I prefer to work in an organization in which knowledge gathering is actively stimulated. I’m also open to doctorate at an university in a part-time program besides my job.</p>
